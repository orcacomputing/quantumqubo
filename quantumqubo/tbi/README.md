# Simulators for the PT-Series Time Bin Interferometer

This folder contains simulators for ORCA's PT-Series. Current simulators are:

### Efficient sampling simulator

This simulator in `tbi_sampler.py` implements an efficient sampling algorithm for single-loop PT-Series. This simulator is helpful for performing extrapolation studies to a large number of photons, athough we expect that for most applications results are improved by having more loops. 

### Other simulators

Other simulators can be made available upon request to ORCA Computing
